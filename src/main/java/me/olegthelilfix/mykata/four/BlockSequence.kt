/**
 * Consider the following array:
 * [1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789, 12345678910, 1234567891011...]
 * If we join these blocks of numbers, we come up with an infinite sequence which starts with 112123123412345123456....The list is infinite.
 * You will be given an number (n) and your task will be to return the element at that index in the sequence, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
 * Assume the indexes start with 1, not 0.
